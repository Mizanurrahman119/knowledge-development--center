            <p> Our online library is a store house of knowledge which satisfies our eternal desire for knowledge of the unknown and unseen. A school library is a place where the teachers and students can read, and from where they can borrow books. In our school, we also have a school library. It is housed in a separate two storied building. Indeed, the library is well constructed. There are many almirahs. The books are arranged on different shelves according to their subjects</p>
